## Description
For our final project, we were having issues coming up with an idea. Despite the myriad of topics we covered in class, we could not come up with an idea that was both a cool use of interactive machine learning and feasible. We knew from the get go that we were excited about the idea of making some form of recommender system, but building one from scratch is one of the most difficult machine learning tasks and we did not have the know-how or time to make one. Throughout the semester, we became very comfortable with leveraging existing machine learning solutions both in the browser using JavaScript and the backend using Python's Flask. As such, we decided to combine our skillset, our love for Spotify, and our desire to make a recommender system to make Moodify, a web application that leverages tensorflow.js for computer vision capabilities in the browser to detect a user's mood and Spotify's API to create a playlist of song recommendations for the user based on their Spotify usage patterns and the mood detected in the browser. 



## Process and Implementation

In the frontend, our web application relies on <a href="https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api.js/"> face-api.js</a>
